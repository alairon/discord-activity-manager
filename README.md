# Project Turf

A cross-platform electron application that allows users to modify their Discord game activity. This is a more modern take using modern web development frameworks like Next.js/React/Tailwindcss and Electron as a successor to my previous project, SwitchRP (which used raw HTML/Bootstrap). The reason I made this again is because I wanted an easy solution to share what I'm currently doing on my Nintendo Switch (because it still doesn't have native Discord integration).

# Heads up
This project is in the early stages and has a sizeable amount of problems &ndash; namely the customization features. A distributable executable will not be provided until the app is in a much better state.

# Running the Source Code
`npm run dev`
> Runs the Electron application with a local React server. This runs the local Next.js server at `http://localhost:3000` so you can edit the frontend code and have it instantly reflected on the device.
